        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>After being colonized by Spain, Germany, and Japan, the CNMI played a key role during 
          World War II. The United States used the islands as a strategic base for launching attacks against Japan. 
          Following the war, the US took control of the islands in 1944, and then officially became a territory in 1978.
